# Amazon
Recreating an e-commerce similar to amazon. We are two students in the last year of high school so don't expect too much (css is stressful btw).
Team duo: Lorenzo Barattin, Gabriele Tommasi

# PHP Pages
Going into the folder "Pagine web" you will find all the php pages that were created in this project (also one file JS):
- account.php: is the page were you can see your orders, cancel them and recharge your credit;
- annullaOrdine.php: it's a page where there is only PHP to cancel an order;
- autenticazione.php: it's a page of only php to authenticate the user after submitting the inputs in the login.php page;
- cambiaPassword.php: it's a page where you can change the password of your account;
- cambiare.php: it has only php to change the password;
- login.php: it speaks for itself, it allows you to login in the account.php page;
- registrati.php: it allows you to register a new account;
- registrazione.php: only the php code to create a new file XML for the new account you just created and add a new account in the utenti.xml file;
- in the JS folder you will find a file "shop.js": it only allows the user to select how much products he wants to buy;
- shop folder: contains all the pages for each category of products and also the page ordina.php:
  - (film, libri, sport, tecnologia, vestiti).php: they have se same code to display different products from magazzino.xml and here you can buy the products;
  - ordina.php: php code to order the products that you buy (only in the page that you are at the moment);

As you can see there is non shopping cart because we thought it in another and simplified way.

# CSS Pages
Going into "Stili" you will find all the css pages we created for the relative PHP pages:
- account.css: linked to account.php;
- cambiaPassword.css: linked to cambiaPassword.css;
- shop.css: linked to (film, libri, sport, tecnologia, vestiti).php;
- styleLogin.css: linked to login.php;
- styleRegistrati: linked to registrati.php;

You may notice that these css are similar to each other except for the shop.css and account.css ones. In fact we asked chat GPT for help and then we modified some colors and other things.
