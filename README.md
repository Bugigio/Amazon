Going into the folder "Pagine web" you will find all the php pages that were created in this project (also one file JS):
- account.php: is the page were you can see your orders, cancel them and recharge your credit;
- annullaOrdine.php: it's a page where there is only PHP to cancel an order;
- autenticazione.php: it's a page of only php to authenticate the user after submitting the inputs in the login.php page;
- cambiaPassword.php: it's a page where you can change the password of your account;
- cambiare.php: it has only php to change the password;
- login.php: it speaks for itself, it allows you to login in the account.php page;
- registrati.php: it allows you to register a new account;
- registrazione.php: only the php code to create a new file XML for the new account you just created and add a new account in the utenti.xml file;
- shop folder: contains all the pages for each category of products and also the page ordina.php:
  - (film, libri, sport, tecnologia, vestiti).php: they have se same code to display different products from magazzino.xml and here you can buy the products;
  - ordina.php: php code to order the products that you buy (only in the page that you are at the moment);

As you can see there is non shopping cart because we thought it in another and simplified way.
